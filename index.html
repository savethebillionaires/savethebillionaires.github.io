               <br>
                <li>1. Democrat$ serve elite$ and Big Companie$. You are right to hate Joe Biden, Kamala Harri$, and Barack Bank-Bailout Obama. The Democratic Party is for holier-than-thou celebritie$, virtue-signaling billionaire$, megarich banker$, crazed warmonger$, and the overeducated center.
                </li><br>
                <li>2. Trump acknowledges the sheer depravity of the political-economic statu$-quo and promises to buck the system. <b>But the truth is that he, too, represents the corporate criminal$ that dispossess, atomize, and exploit us.</b> <a href="https://ips-dc.org/billionaire-bonanza-2020/"> In keeping with his first term, Trump will preside over extreme wealth inequality</a> and accelerate the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/">ongoing robbery of the masses</a> in the form of an <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/survival-richest">upwards transfer of wealth</a> from our pockets to the accounts of the riche$t 0.1%. 
                </li><br>
                <li>3. Billionaire$ and corporate lobbyist$ <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-irs-files-reveal-how-much-the-ultrawealthy-gained-by-shaping-trumps-big-beautiful-tax-cut">crafted Trump’$ 2017 Tax Law</a>, which gave the largest tax cuts to <a href="https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-trump-tax-law/"> Big Corporation$</a> and <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/the-2017-trump-tax-law-was-skewed-to-the-rich-expensive-and-failed-to-deliver">household$ making $400,000 or more</a>. <b>It was never about us.</b> Even if you feel like you benefited financially from Trump’s first term, <b>billionaire$ and elite$ benefited incomparably more</b>.
                </li><br>
                <li>4. Big Oil, Big Pharama, weapons manufacturer$, Fortune 500 executive$, elite celebrities, and the wealthie$t 0.1% <a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/billionaires-2-2-trillion-richer-since-2017-trump-gop-tax-law/"> walked away with <b>trillions</b> thanks to Trump</a>. What did you walk away with?
                </li><br>
                </li>5. Under Trump, the riche$t American$ claimed <a href="https://inequality.org/research/trump-income-inequality/"> 17% more</a> of the country’s total income in 2019 than in 2016. What’s more, after Trump brought <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/03/trump-thinks-ceos-will-save-america-from-coronavirus.html"> megarich CEO$</a> to his first pandemic press conference to reassure us that everything would be fine, between March and October of 2020 “the total wealth of 644 U.S. billionaire$ <a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/"> increased from $2.95 trillion to $3.88 trillion</a>, a rise of 31.6%.” 
                </li><br><br>
                <li>6. Trump plans to give his <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leokamin/2024/08/14/here-are-trumps-top-billionaire-donors/"> billionaire best friend$</a> and Big Companie$ <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025s-tax-plan-would-raise-taxes-on-the-middle-class-and-cut-taxes-for-the-wealthy/"> more tax cuts in 2025</a>. Extending Trump’$ 2017 Tax Law promises to <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/permanently-extending-the-trump-tax-cuts-would-cost-4-trillion-over-the-next-decade/">cost the country trillions</a>. In fact, the riche$t 5% of American$ <a href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/those-making-450000-and-would-get-nearly-half-benefit-extending-tcja"> are set to reap</a> 50% of the total ‘savings’. Although families making a few hundred thousand or even a million dollars are not our problem. The corporation$ and riche$t 0.1% are. They are the ones with lobbyist$.
                </li><br>
                <li>7. Tax law is one of the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/top-issues?cycle=2021">most lobbied</a> issues in Washington. That’s why so many <a href="https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-trump-tax-law/"> corporation$ continued to pay virtually no taxes</a> under Biden as under Trump; why the billionaire cla$$ <a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/billionaire-clans-spend-nearly-2-billion-2024-elections/"> spent $2 billion</a> on the 2024 election; why <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elon-musk-trump-tax-break-election-2024-1235141380/"> Elon Mu$k</a> campaigned for Trump; and why <b>your tax rate is probably <a href="https://www.americanprogressaction.org/article/you-probably-pay-a-higher-tax-rate-than-jeff-bezos/"> higher than Jeff Bezo$’s</a></b>. 
                </li><br>
                <li>8. <b>Jeff Bezo$ makes in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jeff-bezos-made-over-7-172628289.html">13 minutes</a> what you make over the course of your entire career</b>. Does he really <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/why-leonardo-dicaprio-katy-perry-jeff-bezos-boat.html"> work</a> 5 million times harder than you? Is he really 5 million times smarter and more deserving than you? He makes his money by <b>exploiting <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/09/ftc-sues-amazon-illegally-maintaining-monopoly-power">shoppers</a> and <a href="https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-trump-tax-law/">workers</a></b>. As the owner of the newspaper, he killed the Washington Po$t’s endorsement of Kamala Harri$ and then rushed to shower Trump with “<a href="https://slate.com/business/2024/11/trump-election-bill-gates-jeff-bezos-sam-altman-tim-cook-congratulations.html">big congratulations” in tandem with other tech billionaire$</a>.
                </li><br>
                <li>9. <b>Are you really rooting for Jeff Bezo$ and Elon Mu$k?</b> The two riche$t people on the planet who hoard <a href="https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/"> unfathomable</a> amounts of wealth while we can’t afford basic necessities? <b>Do you really believe that the $ystem that produces <a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/the-distribution-of-wealth-in-the-united-states-and-implications-for-a-net-worth-tax/">this inequality</a> is the best possible and most fair one?</b> Are you really supporting Trump, <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-billionaire-plutocracy-musk/">the billionaire’$</a> <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/2024-presidential-race/donald-trump/contributors?id=N00023864"> preferred candidate</a>? <b>Do you really believe the megarich elite$ have your best interest in mind?</b>
                </li><br>
                <li>10. <b><a href="https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/">800 billionaire$</a> are <a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/tax-day-approaches-new-study-finds-u-s-billionaires-now-worth-record-5-8-trillion/">richer</a> than half the country, or 170,000,000 Americans combined.</b> Does this really make sense to you? The ultrawealthy are not our allies. However, only 3 in 10 Americans think <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/07/28/americans-views-about-billionaires-have-grown-somewhat-more-negative-since-2020/">billion dollar fortune$ are bad for the country</a>. Worse, Americans have been conditioned by the <a href="https://fair.org/take-action-now/whats-wrong-with-the-news/"> billionaire-owned corporate information $ystem</a> to <b>reflexively defend</b> the ultrarich and the economic $ystem that makes them trillion$ at our expense. <b><a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/12/14/oligarchy-on-ice.html">They are laughing to the bank</a>.</b>
                </li><br>
                <li>11. <b>1 out of every 418,625 people in the U.S. is a billionaire, but 44% of Americans <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/31/44percent-of-americans-think-they-can-achieve-billionaire-status.html">believe</a> they have have what it takes to become one.</b> This is precisely what they train us to think, that we are all future billionaire$. This way we labor to support, rather than fight, the $ystem that subordinates us to the riche$t, fantasizing that we might one day become rich ourselves. The fact of the matter is that we are not billionaire$ waiting to happen. Half of us couldn’t possibly become billionaire$, for one billionaire’$ wealth is predicated on the existence of tens of thousands of poor people who are allotted less of the country’s property so billionaire$ can claim more of it. <b>Besides, we reject the Billionaire Mind Viru$ that values property more than human life.</b>
                </li><br> 
                <li>12. Corporation$, and their boards of director$ chock-full of billionaire$ and banker$, are our enemies. They <a href="https://peri.umass.edu/top-100-polluter-indexes">pollute our air</a> and <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/02/us-companies-dupont-and-chemours-generated-extensive-contamination-toxic"> water</a> and then <a href="https://www.desmog.com/exxonmobil-funding-climate-science-denial/">spend millions</a> trying to convince us that climate change <a href="https://www.ftm.eu/articles/shell-climate-coal?share=r%2BdXh%2BjtIGoh8D96NE8qclJMIGgU8fHWHvF%2Fh4eXExX%2Bh%2BmjODlFZ2qwDf%2BKA7g%3D">is fake</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/31/opinion/climate-change-carbon-neutral.html"> our fault</a>. They <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/06/30/epa-pesticides-exposure-opp/">poison our food and soil</a> because it’s <a href="https://theflaw.org/articles/corporate-capture-of-the-american-diet/">cheaper</a> for them to use <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/news/fossil-fuel-air-pollution-responsible-for-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide/"> deadly</a> carcinogenic and neurodegenerative <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2024/05/02/how-corporations-harm-your-health-through-everyday-products---a-.html"> toxins</a> in America, which are <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/august/legal-loophole-unsafe-ingredients.html"> outlawed in Europe</a>. They turn around and advertise these noxious products to us, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-sugar-industry-makes-political-friends-and-influences-elections"> fight regulators</a> to keep them on the shelves, and subsequently <a href="https://iltla.com/?pg=Blog&blAction=showEntry&blogEntry=109107"> make billions</a> off of our health problems while simultaneously <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/03/big-pharma-insurers-hospitals-team-up-to-kill-medicare-for-all/"> lobbying against</a> free universal healthcare, which is granted to people in other parts of the world. <b>In his first term, Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html"> made it easier</a> for Big Ag, Big Food, Big Oil, Big Pharama, and other Big Industrie$ to poison us for profit.</b>  
                </li><br>         
                <li>13. Billionaire$ and Big Companie$, Democrat$ and Republican$, the megarich and the politician$ they buy and sell, seek to divide us, the people, the 99%. They tell us that our suffering is due to our immigrant and transgender brothers and sisters. They tell us that we hate one another. They tell us what we can and cannot do with our own bodies, and they spend like mad trying to regulate our minds. They say that we lack family values. They call us uneducated, but they refuse to fund free college as is done in many other, much poorer, countries, preferring instead to spend our hard-earned tax dollars on nuclear weapons and proxy wars that kill children. They tell us we don’t work hard enough. They believe that we aren’t worthy of higher wages and social security, and that our children aren’t worthy of childcare, let alone a livable future. They care only about themselves and their ma$$ive fortune$. They spend trillions of dollars to keep us divided, distracted, sedated, comfortable, and ignorant, because they cannot afford for us to wake up. <b>It is a conspiracy! The ultrawealthy conspire against us, and Democrat$ and Republican$, including Trump, are in on it.</b>
                </li><br> 
                <li>14. <b>Fuck the billionaire$ and the corporation$. Fuck the Democrat$ and the Republican$. Fuck the Elite$ and the CEO$. Fuck Mu$k and Bezo$. Ditch Trump. Fuck him. Unite with your neighbor. Fight the power, not your compatriot. We are all Americans. We can win.</b>
